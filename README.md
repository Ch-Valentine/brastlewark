# Brastlewark app
The application has a page with list of gnomes which `can be searched` by name, age, hair color, gender or profession and the app also has gnome details page. The application can work OFFLINE in production mode. 
For the application I use only `react`, `react-dom` and `react-router-dom` libraries.
## How to run in production mode
* `$ yarn build`
* `$ serve -s build`

## How to run tests
* `$ yarn test`

NOTE: I tested only one file: `src/utils/__tests__/convertGnomes.test.js`
